The table1, table1_original, table2, table2_original text document were retrieved from  article written in 2013 called "Groundwater Quality of Coastal Aquifer Systems in the Eastern Coast of the Gulf of Aqaba, Saudi Arabia" written by Ahmed A Al-Taani, Awni T Batayneh, Saad Mogren, Yousef Habous Nazzal. The purpose of the article is to assess shallow groundwater quality along the Gulf of Aqaba. It also aims to determine the status of saline intrusions, the cause of groundwater contamination and the potential for contamination.

table1.txt contents:
table1.txt contains only the metals, well numbers and the values for the metals for each well, as this is all I needed for analysis. 
table1.txt contains 15 different metals present in the 23 wells analyzed in the article described above. The 15 metals are:
As: Arsenic
B: Boron
Ba: Barium
Be: Beryllium
Cd: Cadmium
Cr: Chromium
Cu: Copper
Fe: Iron
Hg: Mercury
Mn: Manganese

UNIT OF MEASUREMENT: μg/L

table1_original contents:
table_original.txt contains the same information as table1.txt, in addition to:
* Title for the table
* Figure number from article
* Units of measgement (μg/L)
* Mean, Max, Min, Median, SD, N for the samples.
* Key for each of the terms above. 


table2.txt contains physical and chemical properties from the well samples. It contains 20 columns with various chemical properties/elements. The 20 properties are:
